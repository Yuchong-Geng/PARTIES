PARTIES.py is the simplied version of the PARTIES controller which includes management of only the compute-resources (cores, cache, and frequency). It takes an input config.txt which includes the number of colocated applications, and name, IP address and QPS of each colocated application. The simplied version is provided for easier understanding. Management of memory and IO requires more precaution, since random allocation may result in applications being killed by the OS for OOM (out of memory), or hanging due to substantial I/O delay, so the memory wheel shoud be removed in many cases. 

monitorN.py monitors real-time CPU and LLC utilization. It is not needed in the PARTIES manager since PARTIES doesn't rely on resource usage. You can comment out related lines in PARTIES.py if no monitoring is wanted.
